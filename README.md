# Simple-Number-Guessing-Game

---Description---

    This is a simple Number Guessing Game written in Python. The program generates a random number within a user-specified range, and the player has to guess the number. The game provides hints on whether the guessed number is too high or too low.

---How to Play---

    1) Run the script in a Python environment.

    2) Enter 'yes' when prompted to start the game.

    3) Input a top number to define the range (must be greater than 0).

    4) Try to guess the randomly generated number.

    5) The program provides hints:
        If your guess is too high: "You are above the number!"
        If your guess is too low: "You are below the number!"
        If you guess correctly: "Congratulations! You won!!"

    6) The game displays the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
